# Cli Bot assistance for managing contacts and notes
This is a convenient assistant bot that will help you keep in mind everything related to your contacts: you will have their name, phone, email, address, and birthday in one place. You can also manage them as you want to: add another phone, change address, delete the contact altogether, and so on. What is more, you can add notes to each contact (like recipes) and then find them by tag, title, or contact. In fact, this is a small personal social network that you can easily manage!
